History repacking utilities for PydanticAI agents.

This module provides an LLM-powered history processor to summarize and
compress long conversations while preserving essential context.

TODO: repacking depends on task type

    Create an async history processor that summarizes older messages with an LLM.

    The processor:
    - Preserves the very first request (often includes the system prompt)
    - Keeps the last `keep_last` messages verbatim
    - Summarizes the middle section via the provided `summarizer` agent
    - Injects a single synthetic request containing the summary so the main model
      gets compact context, without leaking the summarizer's own prompts

    Args:
        summarizer: Agent used to generate the summary (ideally a cheaper/smaller model).
        keep_last: Number of the most recent messages to keep verbatim.
        min_messages_before_summarize: Only summarize when history exceeds this count.
        summary_token_limit: Hard cap on summary response tokens to avoid bloat.

    Returns:
        An async callable compatible with pydantic-ai ``history_processors``.
